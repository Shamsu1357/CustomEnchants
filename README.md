Customized Minecraft Enchantments

About me! Hello, my name is Shamus, I have been a minecraft developer for about 2 years and a Java developer for over 4. I make minecraft plugins because it's fun, I don't play the game for fun very often, it's just not my thing. I love to make plugins for it though!
